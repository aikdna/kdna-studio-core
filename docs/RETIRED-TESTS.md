# Retired test material (not part of the current verification surface)

The registry of retired material is `tests/retired.json` and the bytes
themselves live under `tests/legacy/`. None of it runs in `npm test`,
`npm run test:all`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, or
`.github/workflows/publish.yml`.

**Every copy registered here is the pre-retirement file, byte for byte.** The
sixteen that had been rewritten on the way into `tests/legacy/` - relative
requires and `__dirname` paths re-pointed to the new depth - were restored to the
bytes their original paths carried, and criterion (e) below records, for every
entry, the complete diff the move itself had produced, so that content change is
on the record instead of inside a hash. Nothing under `tests/legacy/` is ever
run, so a retired copy never needs its relative requires to resolve from the new
depth: adapting a copy for its new home is a content change the gate prints and
an independent reviewer has to sign, not something the gate can rule out by
itself.

Nine suites are registered:

- `tests/legacy/authoring-path.test.js`
- `tests/legacy/creation-engine-persistence.test.js`
- `tests/legacy/creation-engine.test.js`
- `tests/legacy/e2e.test.js`
- `tests/legacy/golden-single-asset.test.js`
- `tests/legacy/public-package-surface.test.js`
- `tests/legacy/runtime-candidate-hardening.test.js`
- `tests/legacy/runtime-export.test.js`
- `tests/legacy/runtime-release-pair.test.js`

They exercise objects the committed graph no longer ships: the retired public
Core API surface (`createProject`, `validate`, `pack`,
`encryptProtectedEntry`) that belonged to the pre-component-semantics graph, the
retired packed member list (e.g. `src/authoring/index.js`), the retired
runtime-candidate authority binding for the 3.0.0 / 0.21.0 graph (whose verifier
now stops on `unbound file lock package: node_modules/@aikdna/kdna-read`), and
the retired stable-release coordinate policy. They are therefore red against the
committed graph. That redness is the reason the retirement exists; the gate
records it as an observation and never reads it - see the delivery report's
section on why these suites are red, which is an observation rather than a
verdict.

The completeness suite that was once here is **not** retired: it was re-pointed
at the committed candidate fixture and moved back to
`tests/runtime-candidate-binding-completeness.test.js`, because the coverage it
carried (the binding rejects hostile lock graphs) still applies to the current
script.

## What a retirement has to register

A retirement is a **preservation** claim, not a story about a red run. Every
entry registers the retired path (`file`), the original path it was retired from
(`original_path`), the `sha256` of the preserved bytes (the retirement's
`retired_sha256`), the commit those bytes are claimed to come from
(`retired_from_commit`), a free-text `reason`, the registration date
(`retired_on`) and the review that accepted it (`review_reference`).

`scripts/verify-retirement-registry.js` reads **no test output**. Earlier
revisions tried to decide, from the judged artifact's own output, whether a run
failed *because* the retired object is gone. That is not decidable that way: a
failing test's title, a `console.log` the test itself prints, a stack frame
naming its own file, and a specifier the move rewrote can each be made to name
any object at all, and each was in turn accepted as proof. The gate checks five
things from files, hashes and the object store:

- **(a) preserved** - the file at the registered path hashes to the registered
  `sha256`, so a retirement can never quietly delete or rewrite the bytes it
  claims to keep;
- **(b) complete** - every file under `tests/legacy/` is registered, so nothing
  can be dropped into the retired directory without a receipt;
- **(c) not a fake retirement** - the original path does not still carry the
  registered bytes, so the file really is out of the current surface rather than
  being registered while it keeps running;
- **(d) re-evaluable** - the registered bytes are put back at the original path
  and run. A passing run is printed as `KDNA-RETIREMENT-RESTORABLE: <file>`: the
  entry is not stale, so restore it or record why it stays retired. (d) is a
  receipt, never an acceptance condition;
- **(e) re-checkable** - the copy under `tests/legacy/` hashes to the registered
  `sha256`, so the registered bytes cannot be deleted or edited without the gate
  going red; and `retired_from_commit` is the commit the file was retired from.
  The gate checks that the named commit's tree really carries the file at
  `original_path` (and that HEAD reaches it), and it derives the move as the
  commit whose parent that is (`--no-renames --diff-filter=D`).

  This is the whole of what a machine can prove about a retirement. It cannot
  prove that nobody wrote the file before the move: a rewrite in a commit of its
  own followed by a "pure" move is indistinguishable from a file that was edited
  long before it was retired, and no history-only rule can tell the two apart.
  The gate does not claim to. It **exposes** it instead: for every entry it
  prints the complete diff of the file between `retired_from_commit` and the move
  commit - and the diff of the named commit's own write, when that commit wrote
  the file - counts the differing lines, and names the entries whose diff is not
  empty and whose `review_signature` does not cover it. Those entries are
  **unsigned**: an independent reviewer has to sign each one `no-content-change`,
  or `change-explained` with a `review_note` holding the reason, before the entry
  may enter a push batch. A gate that is green is not a claim that nothing was
  written; it is a claim that everything written is on the record and attributed.

The exit code is about (a)-(c) and (e). (e) reads git history, so the checkout
that runs the gate has to carry it: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` fetches the full
history (`fetch-depth: 0`) rather than the default shallow clone.

`scripts/run-test-all.js` prints one `KDNA-CI-NOT-RUN:` receipt per registered
entry and fails the run if the registry does not hold. Re-activating an entry
starts by re-pointing the file at current objects and registering the move, not
by deleting the receipt.

The current verification surface lives in `test/` (driven by `npm test`) and in
the top-level `tests/*.test.js` suites (driven by `npm run test:all`).
