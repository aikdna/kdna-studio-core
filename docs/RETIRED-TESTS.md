# Retired test material (not part of the current verification surface)

The registry of retired material is `tests/retired.json` and the bytes
themselves live under `tests/legacy/`. None of it runs in `npm test`,
`npm run test:all`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, or
`.github/workflows/publish.yml`.

**Every copy registered here is the pre-retirement file, byte for byte.** The
sixteen that had been rewritten on the way into `tests/legacy/` - relative
requires and `__dirname` paths re-pointed to the new depth - were restored to the
bytes their original paths carried, and criterion (e) below records, for every
entry, the complete diff the move itself had produced, so that content change is
on the record instead of inside a hash. Nothing under `tests/legacy/` is ever
run, so a retired copy never needs its relative requires to resolve from the new
depth: adapting a copy for its new home is a content change the gate prints and
an independent reviewer has to sign, not something the gate can rule out by
itself.

Nine suites are registered:

- `tests/legacy/authoring-path.test.js`
- `tests/legacy/creation-engine-persistence.test.js`
- `tests/legacy/creation-engine.test.js`
- `tests/legacy/e2e.test.js`
- `tests/legacy/golden-single-asset.test.js`
- `tests/legacy/public-package-surface.test.js`
- `tests/legacy/runtime-candidate-hardening.test.js`
- `tests/legacy/runtime-export.test.js`
- `tests/legacy/runtime-release-pair.test.js`

They exercise objects the committed graph no longer ships: the retired public
Core API surface (`createProject`, `validate`, `pack`,
`encryptProtectedEntry`) that belonged to the pre-component-semantics graph, the
retired packed member list (e.g. `src/authoring/index.js`), the retired
runtime-candidate authority binding for the 3.0.0 / 0.21.0 graph (whose verifier
now stops on `unbound file lock package: node_modules/@aikdna/kdna-read`), and
the retired stable-release coordinate policy. They are therefore red against the
committed graph. That redness is the reason the retirement exists; the gate
records it as an observation and never reads it - see the delivery report's
section on why these suites are red, which is an observation rather than a
verdict.

The completeness suite that was once here is **not** retired: it was re-pointed
at the committed candidate fixture and moved back to
`tests/runtime-candidate-binding-completeness.test.js`, because the coverage it
carried (the binding rejects hostile lock graphs) still applies to the current
script.

## What a retirement has to register

A retirement is a **preservation** claim, not a story about a red run. Every
entry registers the retired path (`file`), the original path it was retired from
(`original_path`), the `sha256` of the preserved bytes (the retirement's
`retired_sha256`), the commit those bytes are claimed to come from
(`retired_from_commit`), a free-text `reason`, the registration date
(`retired_on`) and the review that accepted it (`review_reference`).

`scripts/verify-retirement-registry.js` reads **no test output**. Earlier
revisions tried to decide, from the judged artifact's own output, whether a run
failed *because* the retired object is gone. That is not decidable that way: a
failing test's title, a `console.log` the test itself prints, a stack frame
naming its own file, and a specifier the move rewrote can each be made to name
any object at all, and each was in turn accepted as proof. The gate checks five
things from files, hashes and the object store:

- **(a) preserved** - the file at the registered path hashes to the registered
  `sha256`, so a retirement can never quietly delete or rewrite the bytes it
  claims to keep;
- **(b) complete** - every file under `tests/legacy/` is registered, so nothing
  can be dropped into the retired directory without a receipt;
- **(c) not a fake retirement** - the original path does not still carry the
  registered bytes, so the file really is out of the current surface rather than
  being registered while it keeps running;
- **(d) re-evaluable** - the registered bytes are put back at the original path
  and run. A passing run is printed as `KDNA-RETIREMENT-RESTORABLE: <file>`: the
  entry is not stale, so restore it or record why it stays retired. (d) is a
  receipt, never an acceptance condition;
- **(e) re-checkable** - two things, both machine-checkable, and nothing more.
  First, the copy under `tests/legacy/` hashes to the registered `sha256`, so the
  registered bytes cannot be deleted or edited. Second, `retired_from_commit` is
  the commit the file was retired from: the gate computes `C_last`, the newest
  commit on HEAD whose tree still carries the file at `original_path`, and
  refuses any entry that names a different one - so a retirement cannot be
  anchored at an older retirement that a later one superseded - and the named
  commit has to be reachable from HEAD.

  That is the whole of what a machine can prove. It cannot prove that nobody wrote
  the file before the move, and no history-only rule can: a rewrite in a commit of
  its own followed by a "pure" move is indistinguishable from a file that was
  edited long before it was retired. The gate does not judge that; it prints it:

  - `KDNA-RETIREMENT-DIFF` - the first retirement changed the content while moving
    the file, with the complete diff;
  - `KDNA-RETIREMENT-PRIOR-WRITE` - the commit the entry names wrote the file at
    the original path itself, with the complete diff;
  - `KDNA-RETIREMENT-WINDOW` - every later commit in the retirement window (from
    the first retirement to HEAD) that modified or removed the retired copy, and
    `content_changed_in_window` counts them, the retirement's own rewrite
    included.

  A non-zero window, or a prior write, needs the reviewer's per-entry signature:
  `review_signature` is `no-content-change`, or `change-explained` with a
  `review_note` holding the reason. Entries that still lack one are printed as
  `KDNA-RETIREMENT-UNSIGNED` and may not enter a push batch. **Shape five -
  "rewrite one byte, then move the file" - is rc=0 with the change exposed and
  unsigned, never a red gate.** The refusal shapes are the other ones: a deleted
  registered file, a byte edited in the registered copy, an unregistered file
  under `tests/legacy/`, a `retired_from_commit` that is not `C_last`, and one
  that HEAD cannot reach.

  An entry whose bytes cannot be run where they used to live records that
  explicitly: `reeval_in_place: "not-possible"` with a `reeval_note` holding the
  reason, and the gate prints `KDNA-RETIREMENT-REEVAL-NOTE` instead of reporting a
  run it cannot make.

The exit code is about (a)-(c) and (e). (e) reads git history, so the checkout
that runs the gate has to carry it: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` fetches the full
history (`fetch-depth: 0`) rather than the default shallow clone.

Install with `npm ci --omit=optional`, which is what `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
and the README use. The component runtime deliberately requires the optional
native addon `cbor-extract` to be absent - a bare `npm ci` installs it and
`npm test` then fails with `CREATION_OPTIONAL_DEPENDENCY_UNBOUND`. That is a
design assertion, not a cache property: a warm npm cache with `--omit=optional`
is as green as an empty one, and neither the gate nor the test run depends on the
cache being cold.

`scripts/run-test-all.js` prints one `KDNA-CI-NOT-RUN:` receipt per registered
entry and fails the run if the registry does not hold. Re-activating an entry
starts by re-pointing the file at current objects and registering the move, not
by deleting the receipt.

The current verification surface lives in `test/` (driven by `npm test`) and in
the top-level `tests/*.test.js` suites (driven by `npm run test:all`).
